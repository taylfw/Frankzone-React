          In my free time I like drawing, reading, kayaking, playing bass and
          spending time with my family.

          My career thus far has been varied to say the least. I started out my
          adult life doing <b>manual labor</b> like digging ditches, planting
          trees bushes and flowers for a Landscaping company in the Florida
          heat. I became an <b>Emergency Medical Technician</b> and got my first
          job riding on an ambulance at the age of 21 in Putnam county FL. I
          became a <b>Paramedic</b> at the age of 22 and began working for a
          private ambulance service in Jacksonville Florida. I worked there for
          5 years. In this time I became interested in computer systems and
          started college classes pertaining to such. My last year in the
          medical field was spent working a night shift at a shipyard in
          Jacksonville while I studied network and system administration at
          Florida State College Jacksonville. I got my first IT job in 2016 at
          the age of 28. I’ve spent the last five years performing{" "}
          <b>Desktop Support</b> and <b>Systems Administration</b> at Optimum
          Healthcare IT. I love troubleshooting complex and time sensitive
          problems. I also feel like I’ve developed a lot of team work skills
          over the last decade. Coworkers give me the impression that they
          generally like working with me.

          Due to the recent pandemic, I turned to automating a few of my
          complicated yet repetitive and time consuming tasks using Powershell.
          This is when the coding bug bit me. I’ve been teaching myself
          JavaScript ever since and don’t plan on slowing down. Web development
          allows me to be more creative and gives me the ability to show of my
          personal style in my work.
